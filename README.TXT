ASCII Illustrate
ASCII Illustrate is a simple Java application that allows users to create ASCII art on a canvas. It provides a graphical user interface with features for drawing, erasing, changing colors, saving/loading drawings, and saving as a png file.

Getting Started

Prerequisites:
Java Development Kit (JDK 17)
Open the Application:

Navigate to the dist directory in the Acii-Illustrate folder.
Run the executable JAR file by clicking on it.

Drawing:
►Click the "Char" button to select the characters that you like to draw on the canvas with.
►Input an ASCII character(s) of your choice. Note: Emojis are not supported.
►If you drag over characters that are previously selected, then the current character selection will override the previous character.

Color:
►Change the color of characters by using the color button. The panel that pops up will have tabs that give the user options on how they select their color. 
You can choose the color based on hue/saturation, hue/saturation/lighting, rgb value or cyan/magenta/yellow/black/alpha.

Background:
►Change the background color using the background button.
You can choose the background color based on hue/saturation, hue/saturation/lighting, rgb value or cyan/magenta/yellow/black/alpha.

Erasing:
►Activate the eraser tool by clicking the "Eraser" button.
►Choose the eraser size (small, medium, large) from the drop-down list.
►Drag over characters or click the characters you want to remove.

Save:
►Press the "Save" button.
►Select "New Save" from the dropdown list to create a new save file or select a previous save to save over the previous save. This doesn't create a readable file but saves the user's work to reload in the program.

Load:
►Click the "Load" button to load a previously saved work of art.
If no saves are available, a popup will inform you.

Delete:
►Click the "Delete" button to delete saved drawings.
►A popup will display the available saved drawings. Select one to delete.

Reset:
►Press the "Reset" button to clear the canvas.
If you have unsaved work, consider saving before resetting.

Save as PNG:
►Click the "Save as PNG" button.
►A popup will appear. Choose the file destination.
►Input a file name in the lower part of the popup.
►The popup won't close if you don't provide a name.

Exit:
►Close the application when finished.
By following these steps, a user can effectively draw, edit, save, and load their ASCII art using the ASCII Illustrate program.
