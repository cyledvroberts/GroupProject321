# ASCII Illustrate

ASCII Illustrate is a simple Java application that allows users to create ASCII art on a canvas. It provides a graphical user interface with features for drawing, erasing, changing colors, saving/loading drawings, and saving as a png file.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Java Development Kit (JDK 17)

### First Steps

- Open the Application:
- Navigate to the dist directory in the Acii-Illustrate folder.
- Run the executable JAR file by clicking on it.

### Drawing

- Click the "Char" button to select the characters that you like to draw on the canvas with.
- Input an ASCII character of your choice, or a text string. Note: Emojis are not supported.
- If you drag over characters that are previously selected, then the current character selection will override the previous character.

### Color

- Change the color of characters by using the color button. The panel that pops up will have tabs that give the user options on how they select their color.
*You can choose the color based on hue/saturation, hue/saturation/lighting, rgb value or cyan/magenta/yellow/black/alpha.*

### Background

- Change the background color using the background button.
*You can choose the background color based on hue/saturation, hue/saturation/lighting, rgb value or cyan/magenta/yellow/black/alpha.*

### Erasing

- Activate the eraser tool by clicking the "Eraser" button.
- Choose the eraser size (small, medium, large) from the drop-down list.
- Drag over characters or click the characters you want to remove.

### Save

- Press the "Save" button.
- Select "New Save" from the dropdown list to create a new save file or select a previous save to save over the previous save. This doesn't create a readable file but saves the user's work to reload in the program.

### Load

- Click the "Load" button to load a previously saved work of art.
*If no saves are available, a popup will inform you.*

### Delete

- Click the "Delete" button to delete saved drawings.
- A popup will display the available saved drawings. Select one to delete.

### Reset

- Press the "Reset" button to clear the canvas.
*If you have unsaved work, consider saving before resetting.*

### Save as PNG

- Click the "Save as PNG" button.
- A popup will appear. Choose the file destination.
- Input a file name in the lower part of the popup.
- The popup won't close if you don't provide a name.

### Exit

- Close the application when finished.

By following these steps, a user can effectively draw, edit, save, and load their ASCII art using the ASCII Illustrate program.
